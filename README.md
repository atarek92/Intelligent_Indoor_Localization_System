# Intelligent_Indoor_Localization_System_Utilizing_Zigbee_Wireless_Networks_and_Inertial_Sensor_Integration



In this Project, we proposed an integrated PDR/Zigbee indoor positioning system to provide reliable, continuous and accurate solution. 
PDR utilizes the accelerometers measurements to calculate the distance travelled by counting the number of steps and estimating the 
length of each step. The direction or heading angle is calculated from the gyroscope measurements. Zigbee receiver is connected to the 
system, while other Zigbee modules senders are placed at known locations. Then,uses the received signal strength (RSS) to get the 
distance between the Zigbee module sender and receiver. The experimental results show that the proposed Zigbee/PDR integrated solution 
can accurately determine the position with error distance less than two meters compared to more than five meters in case of standalone PDR. 
In this Project, an android application was developed. The proposed method was implemented inside the android application.
